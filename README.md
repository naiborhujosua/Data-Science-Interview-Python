# Most appearance Algorithms Questions in FAANG Companies for Data Scientist
This repository is used to practices our Python skills by questions of FAANG Companies to improve our coding skills as a Data Scientist. Coding skills as an essential skills to improve how we can analyze our data better through simplifying the code better.

## The Motivations 
I try implementing my Python skills to improve and optimize our code style better and i believe the true education is when you can implement what you learn or **simply learn by doing**.
